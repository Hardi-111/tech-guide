</div><div>Who would have believed this if we had told them about the functions of a pen drive let’s just say a few decades back! Isn’t it amazing how much data you can load onto such a tiny device? Pen drive was invented in 1998 by IBM. Thanks to them, we no longer have to go through the painstaking process of burning CDs or reading through the labels of all the floppy disks in the drawer to copy a movie or store our photos. Pen drives or USB flash drives are basically data storage devices that are typically removable and rewritable. If you want one for your office or for yourself, we can help you get the best.
</div><div>
</div><div>Below is the checklist you need to follow before buying a pen drive.
</div><div>1. The reason why you need them
</div><div>Before you make a purchase, it is always worthwhile to assess your needs. Like the kind of data that you intend to store in the device, your budget, whether you will need to transfer files often, how will you use them, and more. Or do you want to purchase one so that you can gift it to someone in the office? Requirements of each person vary. Make sure to list them out and take your time to analyze each. This helps you to focus on your priorities rather than just going along with whatever you are shown in the store. Below is a pen drive from hp that is suitable for most purposes.

</div><div>2. Storage capacity — the more, the merrier.
</div><div>Your storage needs totally depend on the kind of files you want to save or transfer. Keep in mind that video and image files need more space than text files. A 1GB flash drive can save up to 20,000 pages long text files, 1000 images, 500 minutes of music or 45 minutes of a high-resolution movie. Just take a look at the file details on your computer to get an estimate about how much space you will need.
</div><div>And always buy one that has more storage capacity than you need as the price variations between 8 GB, 16 GB, and 32 GB pen drives are not much. Check out the Sony pen drive price list in India to buy this 32 GB pen drive that is worth the money that you pay for.

</div><div>3. Transfer speed
</div><div>Before we venture into which transfer speed you should go for, you should learn about the two types of USB flash drives available in the market. They are the 2.0 pen drive and 3.0 pen drive. 2.0 pen drive transfers 60 MB data per second whereas 3.0 pen drive transfers 640 MB data per second. That is more than 10 times! But it comes with a price, of course. 3.0 pen drives are costlier than the former. They are also not compatible with all the devices out there that you may end up underutilizing its capabilities. Even if you plug-in a 3.0 pen drive on a computer that is incompatible, it functions like a 2.0 pen drive. Therefore, if you don’t have a computer that supports 3.0 pen drive, stick with the basic one. But if you have one, go for this high-quality 3.0 pen drive.

</div><div>4. Price — watch out for the knock offs
</div><div>Compare the prices of pen drives online before you make a decision based on your requirements without leaving the confines of your budget. When it comes to price, we are always tempted to opt for the cheapest option. But remember, cheap is not always the best. You will end up paying twice if it doesn’t meet your expectations. And beware of counterfeit products online. Even if it costs a little higher than what you had in mind, quality pen drives last a lifetime and will save you money in the long run. Go through the Sony pen drive price list in India to buy one that best suits your requirements. Sony has a wide range of options in pen drives for all budgets.

</div><div>5. Size
</div><div>In the case of pen drives, the rule always is — the small, the better. They are usually around 2 inches long. You can also find them in different styles and shapes that match your personality. But always remember that they should be small enough to be easily carried around in the pocket or tied to a key chain. But they should not be too small that you lose them out of sight. If they come with a cap to protect the metal end from damage or with a foldable design, that would be awesome. Make sure that the cap doesn’t fall off every now and then and ends up being an inconvenience. If you want a pen drive that doesn’t look out of place when tied to your keychain, here is a key-shaped pen drive.

</div><div>6. Privacy protection
</div><div>Do you have classified or personal information in your drive that you want to keep from the outside world? Then, it might be useful to look for something that offers encryption features on the drive. These can be either software or hardware encryption. Here is a 64GB Silicon Power Secure G50 AES 256-bit Encryption USB3.0 Flash Drive to safe lock your data.

</div><div>7. Warranty
</div><div>When buying online, there is always the risk of ending up with defective products. While we hope that it doesn’t happen, it is always better to be cautious and buy from reputed brands that offer after-sale services and warranty. If you go through the Sandisk price list in India, you will find that most of their pen drives come with assured after sales and warranty.

</div><div>Now that you have covered all the checkpoints to tick before buying a pen drive, good luck finding the one that serves all your needs. Share in the comments how you liked them!.</div></div>
